## 31.

夫
兵者
不祥之器也
Now,
weapons
are instruments of ill omen;

物或惡之
Things [people and ghosts] often dislike them.

故
有欲者
弗居
Therefore,
even the man of desire
does not dwell with them.

君子居則貴左
用兵則貴右
The noble man values the left on ordinary days,
the right when commanding troops.

故
兵者
非君子之器也
Therefore,
weapons
are not instruments of the noble man;

兵者
不祥之器也
不得已而用之
Weapons
are instruments of ill omen
and are only used when there is no other choice.

銛襲爲上
勿美也
Though sharp weapons are excellent,
do not beautify them.

若美之
是樂殺人也
If you beautify them,
it is to delight in the killing of people.

夫
樂殺人
不可以得志
於天下矣
Now,
those who are fond of the killing of people
cannot have their way
before all under heaven.

是以
吉事上左
喪事上右
For this reason,
we honor the left on auspicious events,
the right in mourning.

是以
偏將軍居左
上將軍居右
For this reason,
the deputy general stands on the left,
and the chief general stands on the right.

言
以喪禮居之也
This is to say
that they are arranged according to funeral rites.

殺人衆
以悲哀莅之
When multitudes of people are killed,
you should proceed with sorrow and grief;

戰勝
以喪禮處之
When winning a war,
you should arrange occasions with funeral rites.
