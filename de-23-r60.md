治大國
若烹小鮮
Ruling a large state
is like cooking a small ﬁsh.

以道莅天下
其鬼不神
If you deal with all under heaven through the Way,
even ghosts will not wield their mysterious power.

非其鬼不神也
其神不傷人也
It is not that the ghosts do not wield their mysterious power,
but that the mysterious power does not harm men.

非其神不傷人也
聖人亦弗傷也
Not only does the mysterious power not harm men,
but also the sage does not harm the ghosts.

夫
兩不相傷
故德交
歸焉
Now,
since neither harms the other,
they interchange their virtues
and return to their places.
