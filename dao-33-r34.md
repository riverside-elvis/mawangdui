## 34.

道汎呵
其可左右也
Traveling,
the Way
can go left or right.

成功
遂事
而弗名有也
It accomplishes merits
and completes its tasks,
yet does not have a name;

萬物歸焉
而弗爲主
Myriad things return to it,
yet it does not become their lord.

則恒无欲也
可名於小
It has no desires,
so it may be called "small."

萬物歸焉
而弗爲主
可名於大
Myriad things return to it,
yet it does not become their lord,
so it may be called "great."

是以
聖人之能成大也
以其不爲大也
For this reason,
the sage can accomplish greatness
because he does not work toward greatness.

故
能成大
Therefore,
he can accomplish greatness.
