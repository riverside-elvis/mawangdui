爲學者
日益
Those who are learning
build up day after day.

聞道者
日損
Those who have heard the Way
take away day after day.

損之又損
以至於无爲也[^48-1]
By taking away and taking away,
one can reach taking no action.

无爲
而无不爲[^48-2]
If you take no action,
nothing will be left undone.

將欲[^48-3]取天下
恒无事
If you want to acquire all under heaven,
you must always have no commitments.

及其有事也
又不[^48-4]足以取天下矣[^48-5]
If you become committed,
it is not sufficient for acquiring all under heaven.
