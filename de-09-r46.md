## 46.

天下有道
却走馬以糞
When the Way prevails under heaven,
people abandon galloping horses and go farming.

天下无道
戎馬生於郊
When the Way does not prevail under heaven,
war-horses breed on battleﬁelds.

罪莫大於可欲
No crime is greater than lavish desire.

禍莫大於不知足
No disaster is greater than not knowing contentment.

咎莫憯於欲得
No blunder is more miserable than desire for gain.

知足之爲足[^46-1]
恒足矣
If you know that contentment is enough,
you will constantly be content.
