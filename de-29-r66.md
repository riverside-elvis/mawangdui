江海之所以
能爲百谷王者
以其善下之
The reason why rivers and oceans
can be the kings of hundreds of valleys
is that they are good at placing themselves low.

是以
能爲百谷王
For this reason,
they can be the kings of hundreds of valleys.

是以
聖人之欲上民也
必
以其言
下之
For this reason,
when the sage wants to be above the people,
he must,
through his words,
place himself low;

其欲先民也
必
以其身
後之
When he wants to be ahead of the people,
he must,
in his person,
put himself behind.

故
居前
而民弗害也
Therefore,
though he sits in front,
the people do not regard it as harmful;

居上
而民弗重也
Though he sits above,
the people do not regard it as weighty.

天下樂推
而弗厭也
All under heaven pleasantly hold him up
and never tire of him.

非以其无爭與
Is it not because he is not contentious?

故
天下莫能與爭
Therefore,
no one under heaven can contend with him.
