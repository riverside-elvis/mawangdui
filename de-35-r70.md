## 70.

吾言
甚易知也
甚易行也
My words
are very easy to understand
and very easy to practice.

而人莫之能知也
而莫之能行也
Yet no one can understand them
and practice them.

言有君
Words have a master;

事有宗
Affairs have a patriarch.

其唯无知也
Yet only no one understands that.

是以
不我知
For this reason,
they do not understand me.

知者希
則我貴矣
If those who understand me are few,
I will be of great value.

是以
聖人被褐
而懷玉
For this reason,
the sage wears hemp cloth
and carries jade within his bosom.
