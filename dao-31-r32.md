道
恒無名
The Way
always has no name.

樸雖小
而天下弗敢臣
Though an untrimmed log is small,
no one under heaven dares to make it a servant.

侯王若能守之
萬物將自賓
If a princely king can abide by this,
the myriad things will submit to him of themselves.

天地相合
以輸甘露
Heaven and earth unite
to send down sweet dew;

民莫之令
而自均焉
The people on their own
share equally
without being ordered.

始制
有名
When a system was established for the ﬁrst time,
there emerged names.

名亦旣有
夫
亦將知止
Once names emerge,
now,
you should know to stop.

知止所以不殆
Knowing to stop is the way to not be in danger.

譬道之在天下
猶小谷之與江海也
The Way to all under heaven
is like a small valley to rivers and seas.
