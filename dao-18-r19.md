絶聖
棄智
民利百倍
Break off with sagehood
and throw away wisdom,
then the people will beneﬁt a hundredfold;

絶仁
棄義
民復孝慈

and throw away rightness,
then the people will return to ﬁlial piety and benevolence;

絶巧
棄利
盜賊无有
Break off with cleverness
and throw away beneﬁt,
then thieves and bandits will be no more.

此三言也
以爲文未足
These three sayings
are still not enough to be regarded as lessons.

故
令之有所屬
Therefore,
I would like to let something be appended to them:

見素
抱樸
Display the unpainted canvas
and embrace the untrimmed log;

少私[^19-1]
而寡欲
Lessen self-interest
and reduce desires.
