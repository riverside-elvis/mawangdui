大邦者
下流也
天下之牝
天下之交也
A large state
is like the lower part of a river,
so it is the female of all under heaven
and the assembling point for all under heaven.

牝恒以靜勝牡爲其靜也
The female always overcomes the male with tranquility.

故宜
爲下
Because she is tranquil,
therefore she ﬁttingly places herself low.

大邦以下小邦
則取小邦
If a large state places itself below a small state,
it can take over the small state;

小邦以下大邦
則取於大邦
If a small state places itself below a large state,
it can be accepted by the large state.

故或
下以
取
或
下
而取
Thus some,
by placing themselves low,
take over,
and some,
by placing themselves low,
are accepted.

故
大邦者
不過欲兼畜人
小邦者
不過欲入事人
Therefore,
the large states
wish only to annex and nurture others,
while the small states
wish only to join and serve others.

夫
皆得其欲
則大者宜爲下
Now,
everybody gets what they wish for,
so the large states should place themselves low.
