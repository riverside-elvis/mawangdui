執大象
天下往
When the great characters are announced,
all under heaven come [to the palace to see them].

往而不害
安平太
If they come and meet with no harm,
then the world will enjoy calm and peace.

樂與餌
過客止
Food and music
make the passerby stop.

故
道之出言也曰
Therefore,
the Way,
appearing through words,
says:

淡呵
其无味也
Plain,
it has no taste.

視之
不足見也
Though we try to look at it,
it is not enough for us to see it;

聽之
不足聞也
Though we try to listen to it,
it is not enough for us to hear it.

用之
不可旣也
Yet when we put it to use,
we cannot use it up.
