天地不仁
Heaven and earth are not humane;

以萬物爲芻狗
They regard the myriad things as straw dogs.

聖人不仁
The sage is not humane;

以百姓爲芻狗
He regards the common people as straw dogs.

天地之間
其猶橐籥與
The space between heaven and earth,
how it is like a bellows!

虛
而不屈
It is empty
but never exhausted;

動
而愈出
If it moves,
the more emerges.

多聞數窮
Hearing much leads to an early misery;

不若守於中
That is not as good as abiding by the mean.
