絶學
无憂
Break off with learning,
then you will have no worries.

唯與阿
其相去幾何
Between "yes, sir" and "hey, you,"
how much distance is there?

美與惡
其相去何若

how much distance is there?

人之所畏
亦不可以不畏
What others fear,
I cannot but fear it also.

恍呵
How evasive!

其未央哉
There is no end to it.

衆人熙熙
若饗於太牢
而春登臺
All the others are joyful,
like feasting on the great sacrificial oxen
and climbing a pavilion in spring.

我泊焉未兆
若嬰兒未咳
累呵如无所歸
I alone am still and show no sign,
like an infant who has not yet smiled,
and seem to exhaustedly have no place to return.

衆人皆有餘
All the others have more than enough;

我獨遺
I alone am abandoned.

我愚人之心也
憃憃呵
Mine is the mind of a fool---
silly and stupid.

俗人昭昭
Common folks are bright;

我獨若昏呵
I alone seem dark.

俗人察察
Common folks are smart;

我獨悶悶呵
I alone seem ignorant.

忽呵
其若晦
Elusive,
it seems darkened;

恍呵
其若无所止
Evasive,
it seems to have no place to stop.

衆人皆有以
All others have their functions;

我獨頑以鄙
I alone am foolish and uncouth.

吾欲獨異於人
而貴食母
I want to be different from others,
so I value the nourishing mother.
