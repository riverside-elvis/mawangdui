## 4.

道沖而用之[^4-1]
有不盈也
The Way uses itself through the mean,
and remains without flowing over.

淵呵
似萬物之宗
Abysmal,
it is like the patriarch of the myriad things.

銼其銳[^4-2]
解其紛
和其光
同其塵
It blunts the sharpness,
unties the tangles,
softens the light,
and mingles with the dust.

湛呵
似或存
Submerged,
it seems to perhaps exist.

吾不知誰之子也
I do not know whose child it is;

象帝之先
Yet it appears to even precede the High God.
