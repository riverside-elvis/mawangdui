## 29.

將欲取天下
而爲之
吾見其不得已
If those who wish to obtain all under heaven
act on it,
I see that it is impossible.

夫
天下神器也
非可爲者也
Now,
all under heaven is a mysterious vessel,
not something that can be acted on.

爲者
敗之
Those who act on it
will ruin it;

執者
失之
Those who try to grasp it
will lose it.

物
或行
或隨
Things
sometimes go forward,
sometimes follow behind;

或熱
或吹
Sometimes are hot,
sometimes cold;

或彊[^29-1]
或吹
Sometimes are stiff,
sometimes broken;

或培
或墮
Sometimes are piled up,
sometimes fallen.

是以
聖人
去甚
去太
去奢
For this reason,
the sage
rejects the extreme,
the excessive,
and the extravagant.
