## 3.

不上賢
使民不爭
Do not exalt the man of excellence,
so as to keep people from contending;

不貴難得之貨
使民不爲盜
Do not value goods that are hard to obtain,
so as to keep people from stealing;

不見可欲
使民不亂
Do not display the desirable,
and so as to keep the people from being disorderly.

是以
聖人之治也
虛其心
實其腹
弱其志
强其骨
For this reason,
through his rule the sage
empties their minds
but fills their bellies,
and weakens their wills
but strengthens their bones.

恒使民
无知无欲也
By this,
he always causes the people to be
without knowledge and desires.

使夫
智不敢弗爲而已
則无不治矣
Now,
if you keep the man of knowledge from daring and acting,
there will be nothing left unruled.
