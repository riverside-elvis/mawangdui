## 51.

道生之
而德畜之
物形之
而器成之
The Way gives birth to them
and virtue rears them,
so things take shape,
and vessels are completed.

是以
萬物
尊道
貴德
For this reason,
myriad things
revere the Way
and value virtue.

道之尊
德之貴也
夫莫之爵
而恒自然也
The reverence for the Way
and the value of virtue
are not conferred
but constantly so of themselves.

道生之
畜之
長之
遂之
亭之
毒之
養之
覆之
The Way gives birth to them,
rears them,
fosters them,
accomplishes them,
gives them shape,
constitutes them,
nurtures them,
and protects them.

生而[^51-1]弗有也
爲而弗恃也
長而弗宰也
It gives birth to them but does not possess,
acts on behalf of them but does not presume,
and fosters them but does not command.

此之謂
玄德
This is called
mysterious virtue.
