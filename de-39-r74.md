## 74.

若民恒且不畏死
奈何以殺懼之也
If the people never fear death,
how can you frighten them with killing?

若民恒畏死
則而爲奇[^39-1]者
吾將得而殺之
If the people ever fear death,
I will grab and kill
those who behave in strange ways.

夫孰敢矣
Who would dare to do so?

若民恒且必畏死
則恒有司殺者
If the people always fear death,
there will always be someone in charge of killing.

夫
代司殺者殺
是代大匠斲也
Now,
killing people in place of the one in charge of killing
is like hewing wood in place of the master carpenter.

夫
代大匠斲者
則希不傷其手矣
Now,
those who are hewing wood in place of the master carpenter
rarely escape cutting their own hands.
