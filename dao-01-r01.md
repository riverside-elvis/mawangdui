# Part II: 道 The Way

## 1.

道可道也
非恒道也
If the Way can be spoken of,
it is not the constant Way;

名可名也
非恒名也
If the name can be named,
it is not the constant name.

无名
萬物之始也
The nameless
is the beginning of the myriad things;

有名
萬物之母也
The named
is the mother of the myriad things.

故
恒无欲也
以觀其妙
Therefore,
always without desire,
you see the subtlety [of the nameless];

恒有欲也
以觀其所皦
Always with desire,
you see the brightness [of the named].

兩者
同出
These two
emerge from the same;

異名
同謂
They are different in name
but the same in designation.

玄之又玄
衆妙之門
Being obscure and obscure,
they are the gate of all subtleties.
