故
曰
Therefore,
it is said that:

爲道者
非以明民也
將以愚之也
Those who practice the Way
do not enlighten the people,
but make them dull.

民之難治也
以其智也
The reason why the people are difficult to rule
is because of their knowledge.

故
以智知邦
邦之賊也
以不智知邦
邦之德也
Therefore,
ruling a state with knowledge
is disaster for the state,
and ruling a state with no knowledge
is a blessing for the state.

恒知此兩者
亦稽式也
Always understanding these two
is also the ideal of everyone.

恒知稽式
此謂
玄德
Always understanding the ideal of everyone
is called
mysterious virtue.

玄德
深矣
遠矣
How profound
and remote
is the mysterious virtue!

與物反矣
乃至大順
By taking the opposite way against things,
it reaches the great compliance.
