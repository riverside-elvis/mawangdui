## 53.

使我介然[^53-1]有知也
行於大道
唯施是畏
If I were to have slight knowledge
and practice the great Way,
I would only fear becoming boastful.

大道甚夷
民甚好徑
The great Way is very level,
but the people are quite fond of bypaths.

朝甚除
田甚蕪
The courts are well swept,
while the ﬁelds are very weedy;

倉甚虛
服文采
帶利劍
厭食
而資財有餘
While the granaries are all empty,
they [rulers] wear clothes with rich patterns and brilliant colors,
carry ﬁne swords at their waist,
and are sated with food
with excessive accumulation of possessions and goods.

是謂
盜夸
This is called
making a boast of thievery.

盜夸[^53-2]
非道[^53-3]也
Making a boast of thievery
is not the Way.
