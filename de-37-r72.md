民之不畏畏
則大畏將至矣
When the people do not fear what deserves to be feared,
great fear will arrive.

毋狎其所居
Do not obstruct their dwelling;

毋厭其所生
Do not oppress their living.

夫
唯弗厭
是以不厭
Now,
precisely because you do not oppress them,
they do not abhor you.

是以
聖人自知
而不自見也
For this reason,
the sage knows himself
but does not exalt himself;

自愛
而不自貴也
He loves himself
but does not value himself.

故
去彼
取此
Therefore,
he discards that,
and takes this.
