## 79.

和大怨
必有餘怨
Even when great resentments are appeased,
there must be remaining resentments.

焉可以爲善
How could this be considered good?

是以
聖人執[^79-1]右契
而不以責於人
For this reason,
the sage holds the right-hand tally
yet does not make demands of others.

故有德司契
Therefore the man of virtue inquires into the tallies;

无德司徹
The man without virtue inquires into other people's histories.

夫
天道无親
Now,
the Way of heaven has no favorites;

恒與善人
It is always with the good person.
