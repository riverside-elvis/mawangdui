希言
自然
To be sparing of words
is [the feature of] nature.

飄風
不終朝
Fierce winds
do not last a whole morning;

暴雨
不終日
Torrential rains
do not last a whole day.

孰爲此
What causes them?

天地而不能久
又況於人[^23-1]乎
If even heaven and earth cannot last,
how much truer is this for man?

故
從事
而道者
同於道
Therefore,
in their pursuit of affairs,
those who are with the Way
will be one with the Way;

德者
同於德
Those who are with [the way of] obtaining
will be one with obtainment.

失[^23-2]者
同於失
Those who are with [the way of] losing
will be one with loss;

同於德者
道亦德之
Those who are with obtainment
will obtain the Way as well;

同於失者
道亦失之
Those who are with loss
will lose the Way as well.
