## 9.

持而盈之
不若其已
To hold and fill it
is not as good as to quit.

揣而銳之
不可長葆之
If you pound it out and make it sharp,
it cannot be long preserved;

金玉盈室
莫之守也
If gold and jade fill your rooms,
you cannot keep them safe;

貴富而驕
自遺咎也
To be arrogant when rich and noble
causes blame for oneself.

功遂身退
天之道也
To retire when you accomplish merits
is the Way of heaven.
