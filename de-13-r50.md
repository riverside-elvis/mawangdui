## 50.

出[^50-1]生
入死
生之徒十[^50-2]有三[^50-3]
死[^50-4]之徒十有三
When coming out into life
and entering into death,
three out of ten are companions of life,
three out of ten are companions of death.

而民生生
動皆之死地之
十有三
The people contrive to live and live,
so those who proceed towards the realm of death
are three out of ten.

夫何故也
Why is this so?

以其生生也
It is because they contrive to live and live.

蓋
聞善執生者
陵行不避兕虎
入軍不被甲兵
Indeed,
I have heard that one who is good at holding on to life
does not avoid tigers and rhinos
even when traveling in the high hills,
and does not put on armor and weapons
even when charging into an army.

兕
无所投其角
The rhinos,
however,
have no place to jab their horns;

虎
无所措其蚤
The tigers,
however,
have no place to put their claws;

兵
无所容其刃[^50-5]
The weapons,
however,
have no place to admit their blades.

何故也
Why is this so?

以其无死地焉
It is because there is no realm of death in him.
