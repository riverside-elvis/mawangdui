道者
萬物之主也
The Way
is the master of all under heaven.

善人之寶也
不善人之所寶也
It is the treasure of the good man
and what the bad man should treasure.

美言
可以市
Even with ﬁne words,
one can trade;

尊行
可以加人
Even with respectful deeds,
one can excel above others.

人之不善也
何棄之[^62-1]有
The bad ones among men,
how can we abandon them?

故
立天子
置三卿
Because of this,
the son of heaven is established
and the three ministers are installed.

雖有拱之璧
以先駟馬
不善坐
而進此
Though there exists a team of four horses
preceded by an armful of jade disk,
it is not as good as sitting
and progressing toward this [Way].

古之所以貴此者
何也
The reason why the ancients valued this,
what was that?

不謂
求以得
有罪以免與
Did they not say,
"Those who seek shall have it,
and those who have committed a crime
[among those who seek]
shall be acquitted"?

故
爲天下貴
Therefore,
it becomes the most valued thing under heaven.
