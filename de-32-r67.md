## 67.

天下皆謂
我大
不肖[^67-1]
All under heaven say
that I am great
but look unwise.

夫
唯大[^67-2]故
不肖
Yet now,
precisely because I am great,
I look unwise.

若肖
細久矣
If I were clever,
I would long since have been of little worth.

我恒有三
寶之
I always have three things
and treasure them.

一
曰慈
The first
is benevolence;

二
曰儉
The second
is frugality;

三
曰不敢爲天下先
The third
is not daring to be ahead of all under heaven.

夫
慈故
能勇
Now,
because of benevolence,
one can be courageous;

儉故
能廣
Because of frugality,
one can be extensive;

不敢爲天下先故
能爲成事長
Because of not daring to be ahead of all under heaven,
one can be the head of government offices.

今舍其慈且勇
舍其後且先
則必死矣
Now if you abandon benevolence and try to be courageous,
and if you abandon standing behind and try to be ahead,
then you will die.

夫
慈
以戰
則勝
以守
則固
Now,
benevolence
is that through which if one ﬁghts
he will win,
and through which if one defends
he will stand firm.

天將建之
汝以慈垣之
If heaven establishes a state,
you should enclose it with benevolence.
