道
恒無名
The Way
always has no name.

侯王若守之
萬物將自化
If a princely king can abide by this,
myriad things will become cultivated by themselves.

化
而欲作
吾將鎭之
以無名之樸
Having become cultivated,
should their desires arise,
I will subdue them
with the nameless untrimmed log.

鎭之
以無名之樸
夫將不欲
If I subdue them
with the nameless untrimmed log,
they will not have desires.

不欲以靜
天地將自正
When they do not have desires and stay tranquil,
heaven and earth will be correct by themselves.
