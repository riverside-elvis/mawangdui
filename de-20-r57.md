## 57.

以正治邦
Rule the state with correctness;

以奇用兵
Command the troops with strangeness;

以无事取天下
Acquire all under heaven with no commitment.

吾何以知其然也哉
How do I know that this is so?

夫
天下多忌諱
而民彌貧
Now,
the more taboos and prohibitions under heaven,
the poorer the people;

民多利器
而邦家玆昏
The more good devices for people,
the more disordered the state and the clan;

人多知
而奇物玆起
The more knowledge people have,
the more deceptive things will appear;

法[^57-1]物玆彰
而盜賊多有[^57-2]
The more developed legal matters,
the more numerous robbers and thieves.

是以
聖[^57-3]人之言曰
For this reason,
in the words of the sage it is said:

我无爲
而民自化
"I take no action,
yet the people become cultivated themselves;

我好靜
而民自正
I love tranquility,
yet the people become upright themselves;

我无事
而民自富
I have no commitments,
yet the people become rich themselves;

我欲不欲
而民自樸
I desire not to desire,
yet the people become artless themselves."
