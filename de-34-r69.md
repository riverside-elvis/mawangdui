用兵有言曰
There is a saying among strategists:

吾不敢爲主
而爲客
"I don't dare take the offensive,
but would rather assume the defensive;

吾不進寸
而退尺
I don't dare advance an inch,
but would rather retreat a foot."

是謂
This is called:

行
无行
Though trying to march,
I see no enemy's camp;

攘
无臂
Though trying to roll up the sleeves,
I see no arms;

執
无兵
Though trying to hold,
I see no weapons;

仍
无敵矣
Though trying to grasp,
I see no enemies.

禍
莫大於无敵
Of disasters,
none is greater than having no enemy.

无敵
近亡吾寶矣
Having no enemy
is close to losing my treasures.

故
稱兵相若
則哀者
勝矣
Therefore,
when well-matched forces clash,
the one who mourns
will win.
