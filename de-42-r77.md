## 77.

天之[^76-1]道
其猶張弓者[^76-2]也
The Way of all under heaven
is like the bending of a bow.

高者抑之
It presses down the high;

下者擧之
It lifts up the low;

有餘者損之
It takes away from those with surplus;

不足者補之
It supplements those in shortage.

故
天之道
損有餘
而益不足
Therefore,
the Way of heaven
takes away from those with surplus
and supplements those in shortage.

人之道
則不然
The Way of man
is not like that.

損不足
而奉有餘
It takes away from those in shortage
and serves those with surplus.

孰能有餘
而有以取奉於天者乎
Who can model themselves on heaven
while having a surplus?

唯有道者乎
Only the one who has the Way!

是以
聖人
爲而弗有
成功而弗居也
For this reason,
the sage
acts in favor of others but does not possess,
and accomplishes merits but does not dwell on them.

若此
其不欲見賢也
In this way,
he does not want to display his excellence.
