## 80.

小邦
寡民
Regard the state as though it is small,
and regard the people as though they are few.

使十百人之器
毋用
Let those who have multiples of dozens and hundreds
as much talent as the people
not be used;

使民重死
而遠送
Let the people take death seriously
and distance themselves from moving elsewhere.

有車舟
无所乘之
Though they may have boats and carriages,
they have no occasion to ride;

有甲兵
无所陳之
Though they may have armor and weapons,
they have no occasion for displaying them;

使民復結繩
而用之
Let the people again knot cords
and use them.

甘其食
美其服
樂其俗
安其居
The people relish what they are eating,
beautify what they are wearing,
feel satisﬁed with their customs,
and feel comfortable with their dwellings.

隣邦相望
鷄狗之聲相聞
民至老死
不相往來
Neighboring states are in sight of one another,
and the sounds of dogs and chickens might be overheard,
yet till they die of old age,
they never visit one another.
