## 26.

重
爲輕據
The heavy
is the root of the light;

靜
爲趮君
Tranquility
is the lord of haste.

是以君子
終日行
不離其輜重
For this reason the noble man,
in traveling all day,
does not leave his luggage cart.

雖有環館
燕處則超然
Even though there are luxurious buildings and harems,
he rests without any concern.

若何萬乘之王
而以身輕於天下
How can the king of ten thousand chariots
take thoughtless actions with his body before all under heaven?

輕則
失本
In being light,
you will lose the root;

躁則
失君
In being hasty,
you will lose the lord.
