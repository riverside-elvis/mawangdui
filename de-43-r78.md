## 78.

天下莫柔弱於水
Nothing under heaven is softer and weaker than water;

而攻[^78-1]堅强者
莫之能勝[^78-2]也
Yet nothing is better
for attacking the stiff and the strong.

以其无以易之也
This is because nothing can replace its nature.

柔[^78-3]之勝剛
弱之勝强
天下莫弗知
而莫能[^78-4]行也
That the soft overcomes the hard
and that the weak overcomes the strong,
no one under heaven does not know this,
but no one practices it.

故
聖人之言
云曰
Therefore,
in the words of the sage,
it is said:

受邦之詬
是謂社稷之主
"Those who take upon themselves the disgrace of the country
are called the lords of the deities of earth and grain;
受邦之不祥
是謂天下之王
those who take upon themselves the ominousness of the country
are called the kings of all under heaven."

正言若反
Correct words seem contradictory.
