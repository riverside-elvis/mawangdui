天長
地久
Heaven is long,
earth is lasting.

天地之所以能長且久者
以其不自生也
The reason why heaven and earth are long and lasting
is because they do not themselves contrive to live.

故
能長生
Therefore,
they can be long and lasting.

是以
聖人退其身
而身先
外其身
而身存
For this reason,
the sage puts himself behind
yet ﬁnds himself in the fore,
and puts himself outside
yet ﬁnds himself preserved.

不以
其无私與
Is this not because
he has no personal interest?

故
能成其私
Therefore,
he can accomplish his personal interest.
