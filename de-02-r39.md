## 39.

昔之得一者
Of those in ancient times that attained the One:

天得一以淸
The sky became clear
by attaining the One;

地得一以寧
The earth became steady
by attaining the One;

神得一以靈
The spirits became mysterious
by attaining the One;

谷得一以盈
The valleys became full
by attaining the One;

侯王得一以爲天下正
The lords and kings became the masters of all under heaven
by attaining the One.

其致之也
When I take precaution regarding this saying:

謂
天无已
淸將恐裂
If the sky remains clear without pause,
I say,
I fear that it would rip apart;

謂
地无已
寧將恐發
If the earth remains steady without pause,
I say,
I fear that it would be shaken;

謂
神无已
靈將恐歇
If the spirits remain mysterious without pause,
I say,
I fear that they would be irresponsive;

謂
谷无已
盈將恐渴
If the valleys remain full without pause,
I say,
I fear that they would run dry;

謂
侯王无已
貴以高將恐蹶
If the lords and kings remain noble and high without pause,
I say,
I fear that they would topple.

故
必貴
而以賤爲本
Therefore,
if you wish to be noble for sure,
take humility as the root;

必高矣
而以下爲基
If you wish to be high for sure,
take lowliness as the foundation.

夫
是以
侯王自謂
孤
寡
不穀
Now,
for this reason,
the lords and kings refer to themselves as
"the Man in Solitude,"
"the Man with Scant Virtue,"
and "the Man with No Goodness."

此其賤之本與
Is this not taking the humility as the root?

非也
Is it not?

故
致數與
无與
Therefore,
if you count honors,
no honor will arrive.

是故
不欲祿祿若玉
硌硌若石
And because of this,
the sage wishes to be neither glittering like jade,
nor drab like stone.
