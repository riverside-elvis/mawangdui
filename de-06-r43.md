## 43.

天下之至柔
馳騁於天下之至堅
The softest thing under heaven
penetrates the hardest thing under heaven.

无有入於无間
Things with no form enter things with no space.

吾是以
知无爲之有[^43-1]益也
Through this,
I know the beneﬁt of taking no action.

不言之[^43-2]敎
无爲之益
天[^43-3]下希能及之矣
The wordless teaching,
the beneﬁt of taking no action,
few under heaven can reach these.
