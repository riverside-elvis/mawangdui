古之善爲道者
微妙
玄達
深不可志
Those who were good at practicing the Way in ancient times
were delicately subtle,
obscurely insightful,
and so deep that they could not be recorded.

夫
唯不可志
故强爲之容曰
Now,
only because they could not be recorded,
therefore I am describing them arbitrarily:

與呵
其若冬涉水
Hesitant,
like crossing a river in the winter;

猶呵
其若畏四隣
Reluctant,
like fearing all neighbors of the four quarters;

嚴呵
其若客
Reserved,
like a guest;

渙呵
其若淩釋
Supple,
like ice melting;

敦呵
其若樸
Artless,
like an untrimmed log;

混呵其
若濁
Mixed,
like muddy water;

曠呵
其若谷
Extensive,
like a valley.

濁
而靜之徐淸
Muddy,
but they gradually become clear
by making themselves calm;

安
以動之徐生
Steady,
but they gradually become rejuvenated
by moving.

保此道者[^15-1]
不欲盈
Those who preserve this Way
do not want to be full.

夫
唯不欲盈
是以
能弊而不成
Now,
only because they do not want to be full,
for this reason,
they can cloak themselves and remain incomplete.
